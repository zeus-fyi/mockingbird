## Mockingbird

Mockingbird is a time series controlled AI systems coordinator & workflow executor system, data indexer and searcher,
that builds control loops and hierarchical planning rules around higher order goals & objectives using automated evaluation systems and
model-to-model communication via synchronized quorums.

### Usage

Mockingbird is currently a model based supervisor entity, and soon, it will be a Model Supervised Intelligent Network, and now a product you can use, like ChatGPT 4, but with power steering and cruise control.

### Costs

Mockingbird is free to use for the first 3 days, no credit card required to demo the product. Though we may restrict account usage if we see abuse. If you connect your own OpenAI API key, you will be responsible for any costs associated with that, otherwise we will use our API key and then charge you 1-to-1 for the cost of the API usage that we incur, however you may have
your usage throttled if you exceed our usage limits while using our API key.
